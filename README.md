This is my take on the Easy21 [homework](https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Easy21-Johannes.pdf) 
from David Silver's UCL course on Reinforcement Learning. The `implement_homework.ipynb` composed of an implementation of Monte Carlo, Sarsa($\lambda$) and Sarsa($\lambda$) with linear function approximation conrol. The notebook can be run as is, and the requirements are not specified as only very basic packages are used.
